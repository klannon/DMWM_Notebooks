# DMWM_Notebooks
This repository holds the project management notebooks I've created for DMWM.

# Setting up your environment
Assuming you're using `conda` or `mamba` you can use the following:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dmwm-notebooks

# Starting Jupyter
From this directory, run `jupyter lab`.  This will open a tab in your browser and connect it to your notebook.
